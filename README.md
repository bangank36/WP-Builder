# WP-Builder
JSON Schema-based forms with Wordpress Components renderer

## Roadmap
The goal of this project is to replace all controls in @jsonforms/material-renderers into @wordpress/components to take advantage of the full set of [custom controls](https://jsonforms.io/docs/renderer-sets/) such as: duotone picker, datetime picker...

[Project view](https://github.com/users/bangank36/projects/1/views/5)

Introduce the new Layout to display the nested object/array properties into `disclosure` views, bring the app-like UI for the generated forms ( eg: your android phone Settings screen )

### Disclosure Screens
Brought to jsonforms by a new `NavigatorLayout` which will render a whole set of `NavigatorScreen` by rendering the deep nested node into its own `Screen`, in other words: all the object/array nested nodes will be rendered in `flat` structure instead of `nested`.
By default, nested nodes will render `JsonFormDispatch` components, but with the new Layout, they will only render a `NavigatorButton` and pass their `JsonFormDispatch` to root node via Context.
