# WP-Builder
JSON Schema-based forms with Wordpress Components renderer

## Roadmap
The goal of this project is to replace all controls in @mui into @wordpress/components to take advantage of the full set of [custom controls](https://jsonforms.io/docs/renderer-sets/) such as: duotone picker, datetime picker...
